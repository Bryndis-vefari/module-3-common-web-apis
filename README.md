#Common web IPA's

For this project I used a video on youtube by Traversy Media that showed how to make a simple book list. The video was great and took you through every step really clearly. He used bootstrap to style the site and as this was the second time I used Bootstrap, I was familiar with it and played around and I mixed it up a bit by selecting my own theme and adding some more spacing and some other minor changes. He also showed how to use icons from Font Awesome and how to store in the local storage, which I have not done before.
